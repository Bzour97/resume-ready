# Tools

### (Stage 1: Project Design : Task 2.1)

## Visual Studio Code:
is a small but powerful code editor that runs on Windows,MacOS and Linux on your desktop. It features built-in JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js support, plus a wide range of additional language extensions (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, GO) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).

## PyCharm: 
The software produced by the Czech JetBrains company offers code analysis, graphical error detector, a built-in unit test tool, audit control system integration, support for web development in Django, and data science applications in Anaconda. Paycharm is a program that may be cross-platform; Linux, Mac OS and Windows can operate with it.

## Linux:
is an operating system, as are Windows, iOS and Mac OS. Indeed, the Linux operating system operates one of the most popular platforms in the world, Android. The OS is a program that handles all your desktop or laptop hardware resources. Simply explained, the operating system handles your software and hardware connections. The software would not work without the operating system (OS).

## Windows:
is a group of software known as an OS that operates a machine (personal computer). It was first developed by Microsoft in November 1985, and was often modified as the computer memory grew, the chips became quicker and, indeed, the internet invented. PCs used a number of text commands before Windows. Enables the user to engage with the machine (through the keyboard, mouse, microphone, etc.). Checks the data storage (images, files, music). Hardware controls connected to the computer, including cameras, scanners and printing systems.

## GitHub:
is a version management and collaborative code hosting website. It enables you and others to work collaboratively from anywhere on projects. You'll establish your own Hello World repository and discover GitHub's Pull Request procedure, a popular way to develop and evaluate code.

## GitLab:
is a single application, the open DevOps platform. This makes GitLab unique and offers a simplified software workflow which releases your company from a compound toolchain's restrictions. Learn how GitLab delivers unparalleled insight and greater productivity throughout the DevOps life cycle in a single application.

## Comparison Between Visual Studio Code and PyCharm:

| IDE      | Visual Studio Code | PyCharm     |
|    :----:   |    :----:   |     :----:    |
|    Performance   |    Visual Studio Code is a winner, but it will not function very well. Visual Studio Code is a lightweight IDE that is very high. Visual Studio Code is highly dependent on extensions and additional features, and the projects or other libraries are not loaded unless the developers load them.   |     PyCharm contains various backend modules and services required for loading in order to launch the IDE. On average, a very sluggish load time has been recorded for PyCharm.    |
|    Extensions   |    For every framework / platform/language, Visual Studio Code is a modular IDE that may be turned into a complete IDE.   |     PyCharm is a specialized solution for Python developers and you might require additional IDEs such as IntelliJ for Java to download and create.    |
|    Debugging   |    VSCode lets you execute and go through your code in debug mode. On the left side, the variables, the values, the call stack and the breakpoints are shown in the local and global pane. Float over a variable to see its current context value. Also accessible are all normal execution checks, step over, step out. VSCode also allows you to build conditional interruptions that are helpful to search for a certain problem-causing data condition.   |     PyCharm has the same characteristics as VSCode and the debug settings are shown on the bottom pane. Variables and values can be seen, entered, exceeded and deleted.    |

## Comparison Between Linux and Windows:

| Operating System      | Linux | Windows     |
|    :----:   |    :----:   |     :----:    |
|    Access   |    With Linux, the user has access to the kernel source code and changes it to suit his or her needs. It has its own advantages, such as OS faults repair quickly; and downsides such as OS weaknesses may be exploited by developers if they find them.   |     Each user does not have access to the source code in windows; only members of the group chosen have access to the source code.    |
|    Usability   |    The installation of Linux is difficult yet it is easy to do sophisticated tasks.   |     Windows gives userâ€™s a simple system to operate, but it will take a longer time to install.    |
|    Command-line   |    The command line is a highly important tool in Linux for administration and everyday activities but does not make much difference for end-users.   |     We have a command line on Windows, however we cannot utilize a command line with Linux. We need to execute the cmd to open the command line.    |

## Comparison Between GitHub and GitLab:

| Version-control platform      | GitHub | GitLab     |
|    :----:   |    :----:   |     :----:    |
| Fees      | GitHub projects with publicly published codes are free and available to anyone.       | GitLab is a web developer repository that may collaborate on codes solely with its team.   |
| Location   | GitHub does not enable a repository to be located inside a free plan organization.        | GitLab enables its customers to find a repository within a company utilizing the free scheme.      |
| Issue Tracker   | The problem tracker allows requests to be pulled so that the issues that have been raised are immediately shutdown upon fusion.        | In this case, the problem tracker enables users to automatically close problems with PRs.      |

### But now, to work on my project I will choose these tools: Visual Studio Code (IDE), Linux (Operating System), and GitHub (Version-control platform).

### (Stage 1: Project Design : Task 2.2)

## After I finished presenting my unprecedented, powerful, fiery, scorching, scorching review, I will present now, yes, now, and I will provide a comprehensive explanation of the reasons for choosing the tools and techniques I chose to develop my application:

At first, my friend, I will tell you that the beginnings are always difficult, as I was confused between VS code and PyCharm, but in the end I chose VS code because it is a lightweight IDE that is very high. Visual Studio Code is highly dependent on extensions and additional features, and the projects or other libraries are not loaded unless the developers load them. Also among those extensions there is an extension called live server. This extension is based on Live my current server. This extension enables me to download live functionality for dynamic sites additionally Live Server - Makes my current server live - it helps me to reload live dynamic content feature on this web extension. As for the operating system, I chose Linux for several reasons, the most important of which is that I am more comfortable with it, as it is smooth and flexible for me. The other reasons are the command line, since a lot of Linux was originally created to run on servers, so I can navigate the system Entirely using the command line only. Where I also use its terminal to write in it the commands that help me to include my work on GitHub, which is what I will talk about now. I chose the GitHub because the projects with codes published in general are free and available to anyone, as I benefited and learned from other people on this platform Without any cost, which helped us access the repository of our project, me and my group, as we worked on all of them and modified them without any difficulties or Financial costs and quite easily, whatever the systems of our teamwork.
